# Time Series
- Data that is dependent on time
- i.e this data is non-tabular. It has an ordering to it.


<p> Ex. Meals I have eaten vs. Meals I eat throughout the day </p>
- One is a dictionary of my meals, in no particular order.
- The other is a journey of what I eat. I eat an sandwich at noon after eating eggs in the morning.

<!-- ## Technical Definition -->
<!-- $$ y_{t} = e_{t}*y_{t-1} $$ -->

## Potential Properties
- Stationarity: 
- Seasonality
- Autocorrelation

### Decomposition

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os 
# from time-series_files.clean_data import check

df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'Hourly_clean2.csv'))
# check(df)
df.describe()

```


```{python}
print(df['datetime'].nunique())
print(df['Date'].nunique())
print(df['Time'].nunique())
```

```{python}
print(df.dtypes)
```

### Odd Number of Dates. We would expect 365

```{python}
print(df.groupby(by =  ['datetime']).mean())
# print(df['Time'].avg())
# print(df['datetime'].mean())
```

```{python}
print(list(df.columns))
```
